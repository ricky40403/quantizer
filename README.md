# quantizer

----
Propose:
* for personal study.  
* organize the quantization, which can help others to conveniently transform their model to quantized model for testing  

## Enironment
Ubuntu : 18.04  
python : 3.6  
pytorch: 1.3.1  

## Support 
Currently support 
* None


## Target
- [x] Parsing Model's modele  (need to fix data layer, test latter)  
- [x] Merge and convert layers  
- [ ] Adding 8 bit converting   
- [ ] Adding 16 bit converting   
- [ ] Adding 8 ~ 16 bit converting   
- [ ] Seperate as  Fake quantization for training and true quantization for testing.
